;;; Commentary:

;; This file currently contains parts of the package system that many
;; won't need, such as package uploading.

;; To upload to an archive, first set `package-x-archive-upload-base' to
;; some desired directory.  For testing purposes, you can specify any
;; directory you want, but if you want the archive to be accessible to
;; others via http, this is typically a directory in the /var/www tree
;; (possibly one on a remote machine, accessed via Tramp).

;; Then call M-x package-upload-file, which prompts for a file to
;; upload. Alternatively, M-x package-upload-buffer uploads the
;; current buffer, if it's visiting a package file.

;; Once a package is uploaded, users can access it via the Package
;; Menu, by adding the archive to `package-archives'.
